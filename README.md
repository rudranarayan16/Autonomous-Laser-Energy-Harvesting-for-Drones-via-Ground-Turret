# Autonomous Laser Energy Harvesting for Drones via Ground-Turret

This project develops an autonomous energy transfer system where a ground turret uses a high-intensity laser to recharge a droneâ€™s battery. The drone, equipped with an LDR( can also be a Photodiode or PV cell), harvests energy when illuminated. Sensors, including MPU6050, BMP581, GPS, and ESP32, enable precise tracking and communication. Control and processing methods ensure the system activates dynamically when the drone's battery falls below 50%.
